## üß± What is Microservices Architecture?

Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where independent modules are designed and developed, and then communicate with each other to work together in creating an application.

In this approach, specific rules must be followed when creating modules. The foundation of these rules consists of two main principles:

1. **Independence**: Modules should be designed in a way that they are independent from each other.
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each module should perform only one function.

## üéØ Principles of Microservices Development

Key points to consider when developing microservices modules:

- **Independence**  
  Each microservice must be developed and deployed independently from others.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**  
  Each microservice should be responsible for a specific function and perform that function to the best of its ability.

- **Data Separation**  
  Each microservice should have its own database; direct data sharing between services should be avoided, and APIs or messaging systems should be used instead.

- **Lightweight Communication Protocols**  
  Communication between services should be provided through lightweight and reliable methods, such as REST, gRPC, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

- **Error Management**  
  Microservices should be designed to avoid impacting each other. Therefore, solid error management and recovery strategies must be implemented.

- **Versioning**  
  When changes are made to APIs, new versions should be introduced without breaking old versions.

- **Observability**  
  Each microservice should be observable with logging, metric tracking, and monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack).

- **Automation**  
  CI/CD processes should be implemented to ensure that each service can be tested and deployed independently.

- **Security**  
  Each microservice should be secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Independent Development and Deployment**  
  Services can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.

- **Easy Scalability**  
  Only the services under load need to be scaled horizontally or vertically.

- **Technology Independence**  
  Different microservices can use different technologies depending on their needs.

- **Error Isolation**  
  Errors in one microservice can be isolated without affecting the rest of the system.

- **Agile Team Structure**  
  Development teams can be divided and work more agilely and quickly, each responsible for different microservices.

- **Easy Maintenance and Updates**  
  Small, focused services are easier to understand, test, and update.

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

- **Distributed System Complexity**  
  Communication, synchronization, and monitoring between services become more complex.

- **Inter-Service Data Consistency**  
  Lack of a central database may lead to challenges in maintaining data consistency.

- **Management and DevOps Costs**  
  Managing, monitoring, and deploying each service requires extensive DevOps processes.

- **Network Latency**  
  Since communication between services occurs over the network, performance might be impacted by delays.

- **Versioning Challenges**  
  API changes require careful management of backward compatibility.

- **Testing Complexity**  
  Integration testing becomes more complex due to the dependencies between services.
