# What is Layered Architecture?

**Layered architecture** is a software design approach that helps make applications more **modular**, **maintainable**, **testable**, and **reusable**. In this architecture, an application is divided into layers, each with a specific responsibility.

It typically consists of **three main layers**, but additional layers can be added based on the application's needs.

---

## 1. Presentation Layer

- This is the layer where users interact with the system.
- It receives input from users and displays results to them.
- The user interface components reside in this layer.

**Examples:**
- Web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Mobile application interfaces
- Desktop user interfaces

---

## 2. Business Logic Layer

- This layer contains the business rules and logic of the application.
- It determines how data is processed and how the application behaves.

**Examples:**
- Order calculation
- Input validation
- Workflow management

---

## 3. Data Access Layer

- This is the layer that communicates with the database.
- It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Examples:**
- SQL queries
- ORM tools (Entity Framework, Hibernate, etc.)

---

## Advantages of Layered Architecture

- **Modularity:** Each layer can be developed independently.
- **Maintainability:** Errors can be isolated and fixed more easily.
- **Reusability:** Layers can be reused in other projects.
- **Testability:** Each layer can be tested separately.

## Disadvantages

- **Performance Overhead:** Communication between layers may introduce delays.
- **Complexity:** Too many layers can make the system more complex.
- **Increased Development Time:** More code and structure may require more time to implement.
