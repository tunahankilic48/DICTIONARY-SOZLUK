# 🧱 What is Clean Architecture?

**Clean Architecture** is an architectural approach that ensures **flexibility, maintainability, and testability** in software projects. It builds upon the layered architecture model, but applies more discipline by **enforcing strict rules about the direction and nature of dependencies**.

> 🎯 **Core Philosophy:** Applications are built from the innermost core rules to the outer technical details; **inner layers must never depend on outer layers.**

> 🔁 **Dependencies only flow inward.**  
> Each layer can only reference the layer directly inside it.

# 📚 Clean Architecture Layers

## 1️⃣ Domain (Entities)
- The core of the application.
- Contains business rules and core entities.
- Completely independent from all other layers.

## 2️⃣ Application (Use Cases)
- Manages the business logic of the application.
- Answers the question "What should be done?"
- Uses the Domain layer but is not dependent on outer layers.

## 3️⃣ Interface Adapters
- Acts as a bridge between external interfaces and application logic.
- Includes controllers, presenters, and mappers.
- Transforms data to and from formats suitable for use cases and UI.

## 4️⃣ Frameworks & Drivers (UI, DB, Tools)
- The outermost layer.
- Includes web frameworks, databases, API clients, and other tools.
- Should be easy to replace or change without affecting core logic.

# 🚦 Dependency Rule: One-Way and Strict

> **The most important principle of Clean Architecture:**  
>  
> **Inner layers must never depend on outer layers.**  
>  
> This structure ensures:
> - Changes in outer layers do not impact the core.
> - Core business logic remains protected.
> - Testing and maintenance become easier.

# ✅ Advantages of Clean Architecture

| Advantage               | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 🔧 **Modularity**         | Isolated layers allow changes without affecting others. |
| 🧪 **Testability**        | Business logic can be tested independently from external systems. |
| 🔒 **Dependency Control** | Dependency flow is clear and one-directional. |
| 📖 **Readability**        | Responsibilities are clearly separated, making code easier to understand. |
| 🏗️ **Sustainability**     | Even large projects can remain maintainable over time. |
