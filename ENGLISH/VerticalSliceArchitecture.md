# üß© What is Vertical Slice Architecture?

**Vertical Slice Architecture** is a modern architectural approach that structures software not by traditional layers (UI, Business Logic, Data Access), but by **features and functionality**. In this model, the system is divided into independent slices, each representing a complete end-to-end feature.

## üéØ Example: E-Commerce Product Page

Let‚Äôs consider the product-related page in an e-commerce site:

- In **[Layered Architecture](https://github.com/tunahankilic48/DICTIONARY-SOZLUK/blob/main/ENGLISH/LayeredArchitecture.md)**: The system is structured into layers such as `UI`, `Business Logic`, and `Data Access`. These layers serve technical responsibilities and are often shared across features.
  
- In **Vertical Slice Architecture**: The system is divided by features like `GetProducts`, `CreateProduct`, and `UpdateProduct`. Each slice contains everything it needs (UI, logic, data) and operates independently.

## üîç Key Characteristics of Vertical Slice Architecture

- **Feature-Based Structure**: Each feature (e.g., `User Registration`, `Add Product`) resides in its own folder, containing all components (UI, logic, data access) needed for that feature.
- **Independent Development**: Slices can be developed, tested, and deployed independently‚Äîsimilar to microservices but within a single project.
- **Different from Layered Architecture**:
  - Layered architecture organizes code by **responsibilities**.
  - Vertical Slice organizes code by **features**.

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Adding or modifying features is easier since each slice is self-contained.
- **Clarity**: Developers can focus on one slice at a time, reducing complexity.
- **Testability**: Each slice can be tested in isolation, enabling better automation and CI.
- **Scalability**: Only the required slices can be scaled, improving efficiency.
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work independently on different slices.
- **CQRS Friendly**: Naturally aligns with Command and Query Responsibility Segregation.

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

- Has a learning curve for those new to the pattern.
- Managing cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, validation) can be more complex.
- As the application grows, the number of slices increases‚Äîrequiring a management strategy.
- Potential for code duplication across slices if shared components aren't well abstracted.

| Feature / Architecture             | [Layered Architecture](https://github.com/tunahankilic48/DICTIONARY-SOZLUK/blob/main/ENGLISH/LayeredArchitecture.md)                  | [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/tunahankilic48/DICTIONARY-SOZLUK/blob/main/ENGLISH/CleanArchitecture.md)                         | Vertical Slice Architecture                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Organization Principle**         | Based on technical layers (UI, BL, DAL)| Domain-centric with abstractions            | Based on features and actions               |
| **Separation of Concerns**         | By technical responsibility            | By domain and dependency direction           | By end-to-end feature responsibility         |
| **Dependency Direction**           | UI ‚Üí Business ‚Üí Data                   | Outside layers depend on the core (DI)       | All components in a slice work together      |
| **Extensibility**                  | Adding new layers can be difficult     | Flexible but may become complex              | Easy to add new features independently       |
| **Testability**                    | Layer-based testing                    | Highly testable                             | Easy to test per feature                     |
| **Code Organization**              | Organized by layers                    | Organized by layers, domain-oriented         | Organized by features (e.g., GetX, CreateY)  |
| **App Complexity Suitability**     | Suitable for simple apps               | Best for large, complex domain systems       | Fits any scale, especially APIs/microservices|
| **Common Use Cases**              | Traditional enterprise apps            | Large-scale domain-driven apps               | Modern APIs, microservice-like architectures |
| **Main Advantage**                 | Easy to learn, widely used             | Domain flexibility, clear abstractions       | Fast development, clear separation           |
| **Main Drawback**                  | Tight coupling across layers           | Steeper learning curve                       | Managing shared logic and many slices        |
