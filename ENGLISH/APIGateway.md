# What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a server that acts as a **single entry point** for clients in a **[microservices architecture](https://github.com/tunahankilic48/DICTIONARY-SOZLUK/blob/main/ENGLISH/MicroserviceArchitecture.md)**. It receives requests, authenticates them, routes them to the appropriate backend services, transforms them if necessary, and returns the response to the client.

## üîß What Does an API Gateway Do?

- Handles all API requests centrally
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Performs authentication and authorization
- Implements rate limiting, throttling, logging, and monitoring
- Can cache responses to improve performance
- Aggregates responses from multiple services
- Performs protocol translation (e.g., HTTP to gRPC)

---

## üéØ Why Use an API Gateway?

- **Centralized access**: All microservices are accessible through a single endpoint
- **Security**: JWT, OAuth, and API key mechanisms can be enforced centrally
- **Abstraction**: Clients don‚Äôt need to know internal service details
- **Performance**: Caching, rate limiting, and load balancing improve response times

---

## üöß Disadvantages

- Can be a **single point of failure** (mitigated with high availability setup)
- May become a **performance bottleneck** under high traffic
- Introduces additional configuration and management complexity

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Central enforcement of security policies
- Unified API monitoring and management
- Isolates microservices from external access
- Simplifies scaling and maintenance

## üìå Summary

An **API Gateway** plays a critical role in microservices architectures. It acts as a central hub for managing communication between clients and backend services. It enhances security, observability, and maintainability, but must be carefully managed to avoid being a bottleneck or a single point of failure.
