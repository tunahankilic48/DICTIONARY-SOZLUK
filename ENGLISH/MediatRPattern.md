# MediatR Pattern

**MediatR** is a **mediator pattern** used in .NET applications. This pattern prevents components in the application from communicating directly with each other and ensures that all communication occurs via **MediatR**. MediatR is compatible with **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and **Event-driven** architectures, and is especially useful for **loosening dependencies** and **abstracting operations**.

### ðŸ“– **Purpose of MediatR Pattern**

The MediatR pattern allows you to use a **handler** to process a **command** (command) or **query** (query) when sent. A **mediator** layer is added to loosen the dependencies between the application logic and data access operations.

In essence, the **MediatR** tool ensures that when a **command** or **query** is sent, it is routed to the appropriate **handler**.

### ðŸ”„ **Core Components of MediatR**

1. **Request**:
   - Can be either **Command** or **Query**.
   - **Command**: Operations that will modify the system (e.g., creating a user record).
   - **Query**: Operations that retrieve data from the system (e.g., listing all users).

2. **Handler**:
   - Takes the **Request** (command or query) and processes it with the appropriate business logic.
   - There is a specific **handler** for each command or query.

3. **Mediator**:
   - A component provided by the **MediatR** library.
   - Facilitates communication between the **Request** and the **Handler**. When a **Request** is sent, the **Mediator** routes it to the appropriate **Handler**.

### ðŸ§  **Advantages of MediatR Pattern**

- **Loose Coupling**:
  - **MediatR** removes direct dependencies between components. A **handler** doesn't directly reference another **handler**, it only communicates through **MediatR**.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
  - Each **handler** is responsible for only a specific task. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

- **Ease of Testability**:
  - Since each command or query has its own **handler**, tests can easily be written for each individual **handler**.

- **Extensibility and Flexibility**:
  - New commands or queries can be added without modifying existing code.

- **High Encapsulation**:
  - Operation and data logic are separated, which makes the application easier to extend and maintain.

### ðŸš« **When Not to Use MediatR**

- **Small and Simple Applications**:
  - If the application is very simple, the **MediatR** pattern may add unnecessary complexity.

- **High Performance Requirements**:
  - **MediatR** adds an additional layer for each request. If a large number of operations are executed, this can lead to **performance issues**.

---

### ðŸ”š **Summary**

**MediatR** is a pattern used in software development to facilitate communication between **commands** and **queries** via a **mediator**. This pattern reduces dependencies between application components, increases testability, and simplifies maintenance.

#### **Advantages**:
- Provides independence and scalability.
- Increases the manageability of the code.
- Enables advanced testing scenarios.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- Can introduce **unnecessary complexity** in small projects.
- Care should be taken regarding **performance** issues.
